# Privacy Policy for Nagi

Nagi is a music player designed with speed, simplicity, and user privacy in mind. This document explains how Nagi handles your data and interacts with third-party services.

## Local-First Philosophy

Nagi is primarily a local music player. Your music library, playlists, and playback history are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or sell your personal data.

## Third-Party Services (Opt-In)

Nagi offers several optional features that connect to online services to enhance your experience. **All online integrations are disabled by default and are completely opt-in.**

When you enable these services, Nagi may share specific, non-identifiable metadata (such as artist names, album titles, or track names) with the following providers:

### Metadata and Artwork
Nagi can fetch high-quality artist biographies and album artwork from:
- **MusicBrainz**: For structured music metadata.
- **TheAudioDb**: For artist biographies and images.
- **Fanart.tv**: For high-quality background images and logos.
- **Spotify**: For artist and album metadata.
- **Last.fm**: For artist information.

### Lyrics
Nagi can fetch lyrics for your tracks from:
- **LrcLib**: A community-driven lyrics database.
- **NetEase Music**: For synchronized and plain text lyrics.

### Scrobbling and Social
- **Last.fm Scrobbling**: If you choose to connect your Last.fm account, Nagi will send your playback history (track name, artist, timestamp) to Last.fm so you can track your listening habits.
- **Discord Rich Presence**: If enabled, Nagi will share your currently playing track details with your Discord client to display as your status.

### Application Updates
- **Update Checks**: Nagi periodically checks for new versions by contacting GitHub. This sends a standard request to GitHub's servers. This can be disabled in the Settings.

## Data Usage

When Nagi communicates with these services, it only sends the minimum metadata required to fulfill the request (e.g., searching for "Artist - Track"). No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent unless required for account-based services like Last.fm scrobbling, which requires you to authenticate directly with the provider.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this document.
